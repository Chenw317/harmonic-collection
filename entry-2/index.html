    <h1> Miso Soup: Calm </h1>
      <p>Calm as an emotion is characterized by a sense of peace, serenity, and balance. 
        It’s a state of mind where everything feels centered and smooth. There are no strong feelings. 
        This emotion is often associated with feelings of comfort, safety, and quiet reflection. </p>

      <p>Miso soup is very like the emotional state of calm. It is minimal yet deeply satisfying. 
        It doesn’t demand attention, it is very casual but it provides nourishment and comfort. 
        Its ingredients are in perfect balance: the umami of miso, the soft tofu, and the seaweed all 
        come together harmoniously in the soup, and the flavor all sits together well, much like calm 
        emotions where everything feels in alignment. </p>

      <p>The process of making miso soup is also very calming. Slowly stirring the miso paste into the 
        broth, watching the steam rise, scooping the soup in spoonfuls, and then quietly sipping—is meditative. 
        This mirrors the quiet, reflective nature of calmness, where nothing is rushed, and everything is about 
        savoring the present moment. </p>
      
    <h2>How is Miso Soup calm? </h2>

      <p> Miso soup is a simple and humble dish that illustrates comfort and balance. It’s soothing in both the 
        preparation and consumption process. Miso soup is subtle, the savory umami base provides a comforting, 
        delicate taste. It is not aggressive or overpowering, instead it offers a sense of warmth and satisfaction 
        that gently envelops the mind. The texture of the miso soup is soft and gentle. The broth is smooth, the tofu 
        adds a tender and yielding texture. The seaweed offers a slight, gentle chewy resistance. The texture in the 
        soup doesn’t surprise or challenge our buds but rather reassures our buds. </p>

    <h2> Palette for Miso Soup </h2>
      <h3> Light greens </h3>
        <p> This color represents balance and nature, the green tones of seaweed are also a reminiscent of tranquility 
          that is often found in nature. The color of green tea leaves and matcha also aligns with calm. </p>
        
      <h3> Pale whites </h3>
        <p> The tofu in miso soup brings in a soft neutral white color that gives out a sense of purity and simplicity. 
          This is a key to creating a calming atmosphere. The white color also reflects stillness and an absence of chaos. </p>

    <h2> How to make Miso Soup </h2>
      <h3> Ingredients! </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>4 cups of cold water </li>
          <li>One 6-by-4-inch piece of dried kelp </li>
          <li>2 cups of dried bonito flakes </li>
          <li>1/2 cup of dried seaweed </li>
          <li>1/4 to 1/2 cup of miso </li>
          <li>1 cup of soft tofu cut into small cubes </li>
          <li>scallions finely chopped (Optional)
        </ul>

        <h3>For the dashi stock </h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Combine the cold water and dried kelp in a medium pot. Place the pot over medium heat; as the water comes to 
              a simmer, you'll see tiny bubbles start to form on the bottom of the pot. Do not let the water come to a boil; 
              it should remain at a low simmer. Remove the dried kelp. </li>
            <li>Once the water starts to simmer gently, sprinkle in the bonito flakes. Let the flakes steep without stirring 
              for 1 to 2 minutes. Turn off the heat and strain the mixture through a cheesecloth-lined sieve into another medium
               pot. You should have about 4 cups of dashi stock. </li>
          </ol>

        <h3> For the miso soup </h3>
          <ol>
            <li>to reconstitute the seaweed seaweed, place 1 cup hot water in a medium bowl and sprinkle in the seaweed; let 
              it soak for about 2 minutes. Rinse the seaweed under cold water, squeeze out the water with your hands and then 
              chop the seaweed. </li>
            <li>Heat the dashi stock over medium-low heat until just under a simmer. Add the seaweed and allow to cook and 
              intermingle for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Submerge a small sieve into the saucepan until the rim is just above the stock. Add 1/4 cup of the miso to 
              the sieve and use a wooden spoon to work the miso through the sieve into the soup; this will prevent lumps from
               forming. Stir well and taste the soup -- if it's not salty enough, add additional miso.</li>
            <li>Add the tofu and let them cook in the broth just until warmed through, about 1 minute. </li>
            <li>Add optional scallion </li>
          </ol>
