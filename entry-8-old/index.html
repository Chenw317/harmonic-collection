    </div>


    <div>
      <p>Sadness is an emotion that flows softly, often quiet and introspective. Sadness can be  felt when we experience loss, disappointment, or longing. It can show up as a dull and lingering ache, a quiet heaviness, or just a rush of simple tears. Sadness helps us process difficult situations by slowing us down and allowing us to reflect. Sometimes in this process, it brings others closer to offer support. In a way, sadness grounds us. It reminds us of the value of things we hold precious to heart, the connections we miss, or dreams that may have shifted. </p>

      <p>Blueberry compote is a simple fruitbased sauce made by cooking fresh or frozen blueberries with a bit of sugar and sometimes added with a splash of water or lemon juice. As the blueberries heat up, they soften and release their juices thickening into a sauce. The sauce has a consistency between a syrup and a chunky jam. The flavor of the berries becomes more intense, thick, and sweeter as they cook. There will be a touch of tartness that balances the sweetness. Some recipes may include honey and or fresh herbs like lavender for a sweet floral note. </p>

        <p>Blueberry compote can be enjoyed warm or cold. It is commonly used as a topping for pancakes, waffles, yogurt, oatmeal, and desserts like cheesecake or ice cream. It’s simple to make and versatile, adding a fruity, slightly tangy sweetness to any dish. </p>

          <h2> Ingredients! </h2>

          <li>Fresh blueberries or frozen blueberries </li>
          <li>Sugar </li>
          <li>Water</li>

        </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Blueberry compote </h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Zest and juice the lemon </li>
            <li>Add the lemon juice, lemon zest, sugar, water, and half of the blueberries to a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a low simmer and cook for 8 minutes, stirring occasionally.    </li>
            <li>Add the remaining blueberries and cook for another 2 - 8 minutes, depending on your desired texture. If you want some blueberries that are soft, but still mostly whole, stop after 2 minutes. </li>
            <li>Serve blueberry compote immediately, or set aside to cool and store for later. The compote will thicken as it cools. </li>

          </ol>

          <ul>
            <h3>SPARKLE NOTES </h3>

            <li> Be sure to pick over the blueberries and remove any stems before adding them to the sauce pan! </li>
            <li> Taste your blueberries before adding the sugar: Sometimes those blueberries are sweet and sun-ripened and sometimes they are meh. If they are nice and sweet, add less sugar, if they are not, add more sugar.</li>
            <li> Adjust the cooking time to adjust the texture: Want some blueberries in your compote that are still kind of holding their shape? Only cook for 2 minutes after adding the second batch. If you want them all falling apart, cook for another 8 minutes.</li>
            <li> Replace granulated sugar with maple syrup: If you would like to avoid refined sugar, you can replace it with an equal amount of maple syrup.</li>
            <li> Store blueberry compote in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 5-7 days. Remember that it has less sugar than jam, so it must be consumed quickly. </li>
            <li>Compote freezes very well, place in a freezer-safe container for up to two months. </li>

          </ul>
